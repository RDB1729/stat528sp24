This homework set will cover problems concerning exponential family theory. All derivations must be typed. Screenshots of work done with pen and paper will not be accepted.

\noindent{\bf Problem 1}: Verify that displayed equation 7 in the exponential family notes holds for the binomial distribution, the Poisson distribution, and the normal distribution with both $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ unknown.

\vspace*{1cm}

\noindent{\bf Problem 2}: This problem concerns the proof of Theorem 3 in the exponential family notes. Do the following: 

- **part a**: Show that the second derivative of the map $h$ is equal to $-\nabla^2 c(\theta)$ and justify that this matrix is negative definite when the exponential family model is identifiable.
- **part a**: Finish the proof of Theorem 3.

Note that part a will be referenced later in this course. Hence, it is treated as its own sub-problem.

\noindent{\bf Problem 3}: Let $y$ be a regular full exponential family with canonical parameter $\theta$. Verify that $y$ is sub-exponential.

\vspace*{1cm}

\noindent{\bf Problem 4}: In the notes it was claimed that the scalar products of $\sum_{i=1}^n\{y_i - \nabla c(\theta)\}$ are also sub-exponential (see the "Finite sample concentration of MLE" section in the exponential family notes). Show that this is in fact true when the observations $y_i$ are iid realizations from a regular full exponential family.

\noindent{\bf Problem 5}: Derive the MLEs of the canonical parameters of the binomial distribution and the normal distribution with both $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ unknown.

\vspace*{1cm}

\noindent{\bf Problem 6}: Derive the asymptotic distribution for $\hat\tau$, the MLE of the submodel mean value parameter vector. Hint: use the [Delta method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_method).

\noindent{\bf Problem 7}: Prove Lemma 1 in the exponential family notes.
